       Semantic Metadata Annotation for Network Anomaly Detection
         draft-netana-opsawg-nmrg-network-anomaly-semantics-00

Abstract

   This document explains why and how semantic metadata annotation helps
   to test and validate outlier detection, supports supervised and semi-
   supervised machine learning development and make anomalies for humans
   apprehensible.  The proposed semantics uniforms the network anomaly
   data exchange between and among operators and vendors to improve
   their network outlier detection systems.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Outlier Detection

   Outlier Detection, also known as anomaly detection, describes a
   systematic approach to identify rare data points deviating
   significantly from the majority.  Outliers are commonly classified in
   three categories:

   Global outliers:
      A data point is considered a global outlier if its value is far
      outside the entirety of a data set.  For example, an average
      dropped packet count is between 0 and 10 per minute during a one
      week observation and the observed global outlier was 100000
      packets.

   Contextual outliers:
      A data point is considered a contextual outlier if its value
      significantly deviates from the rest of the data points in the
      same time series context.  For example, the forwarded packet

      volume in a timeseries are changing during the time of the day
      like an oscillation curve, where the observed contextual packet
      volume outlier is outside the oscillation curve at that moment in
      time.  At another time the same value could be considered normal.

   Collective outliers:
      A subset of data points within a data set is considered anomalous
      if those values as a collection deviate significantly from the
      entire data set, but the values of the individual data points are
      not themselves anomalous in either a contextual or global sense.
      In Network Telemetry time series, one way this can manifest is
      that the amount of network path and interface state changes
      matches the time range when the forwarded packet volume decreases
      as a group.

   For each outlier a score between 0 and 1 is being calculated.  The
   higher the value, the higher the probability that the observed data
   point is an outlier.

1.2.  Data Mesh

   The Data Mesh [Deh22] Architecture distinguishes between operational
   and analytical data.  Operational data refers to collected data from
   operational systems.  While analytical data refers to insights gained
   from operational data.

   In terms of network observability, semantics of operational network
   metrics are defined by IETF and are categorized as described in the
   Network Telemetry Framework [RFC9232] in the following three
   different network planes:

   Management Plane:
      Time series data describing the state changes and statistics of a
      network node and its components.  For example, Interface state and
      statistics modelled in ietf-interfaces.yang [RFC8343]

   Control Plane:
      Time series data describing the state and state changes of network
      reachability.  For example, BGP VPNv6 unicast updates and
      withdrawals exported in BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) [RFC7854]
      and modeled in BGP [RFC4364]

   Forwarding Plane:
      Time series data describing the forwarding behavior of packets and
      its data-plane context.  For example, dropped packet count
      modelled in IPFIX entity forwardingStatus(IE89) [RFC7270] and
      packetDeltaCount(IE2) [RFC5102] and exportet with IPFIX [RFC7011].

Internet-Draft          Network Anomaly Semantics           October 2023


   In terms of network observability, semantics of analytical data
   refers to incident notifications or service level indicators.  For
   example the incident notification described in Section 7.2 of
   [I-D.feng-opsawg-incident-management], the health status and symptoms
   described in the Service Assurance Intend Based Networking [RFC9418]
   or the precision availability metrics defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-pam]
   or network anomalies and its symptoms as described in this document.

1.3.  Observed Symptoms

   In this section observed network symptoms are specified and
   categorized according to the following scheme:

   Plane:  In which network plane, Network Telemetry Framework
      [RFC9232], it was observed in a global, contextual or collective
      outlier.

   Action:  Which action the network node performed for a packet in the
      Forwarding Plane, a path or adjancency in the Control Plane or
      state or statistical changes in the Management Plane.  For
      Forwarding Plane we distinguish between missing, where the drop
      occured outside the measured network node, drop and on-path delay,
      which was measured on the network node.  For control-plane we
      distinguish between reachability, which refers to a change in the
      routing or forwarding information base (RIB/FIB) and adjcacency
      which refers to a change in peering or link-layer resolution.  For
      Management Plane we refer to state or statistical changed on
      interfaces.

   Reason:  For each action one or more reasons describinging why this
      action was used.  For Drops in Forwarding Plane we distinguish
      between Unreachable because network layer reachability information
      was missing, Administered because an administrator configured a
      rule preventing the forwarding for this packet and Corrupt where
      the network node was unable to determine where to forward to due
      to packet, software or hardware error.  For On-Path Delay we
      distinguish between Minimum, Average and Maximum Delay for a given
      Flow.

   Relation:  For each reason one or more relation describe the cause
      why the action was chosen.  These reason could relate network
      plane entity, a packet, control-plane or node administered
      instruction.

1.4.  Semantic Metadata

   Metadata adds additional context to data.  For instance, in networks
   the software version of a network node where management plane metrics
   are obtained from as described in
   [I-D.claise-opsawg-collected-data-manifest].  Where in Semantic
   Metadata the meaning or ontology of the annotated data is being
   described.

   For example a global network outlier describes a data point of a high
   packet count with packetDeltaCount(IE2) of dropped traffic with
   reason code dropped and status code unroutable in
   forwardingStatus(IE89).  The annotation would be that it is
   classified as global network outlier in the forwarding plane of a
   network.

   It could also have been observed alongside a control plane time
   series for the same network service where network reachability has
   been withdrawn with BGP.  In case of collective network outlier, the
   same data points would now being described as collective network
   outlier in the forwarding plane with a control plane network
   reachability withdrawal and customer impacting context.
