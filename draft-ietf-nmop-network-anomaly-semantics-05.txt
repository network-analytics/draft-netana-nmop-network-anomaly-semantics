       Semantic Metadata Annotation for Network Anomaly Detection
              draft-ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-semantics-04

Abstract

   This document explains the motivation for defining semantic metadata
   annotations to help testing, validating and comparing Outlier and
   Symptom detection systems.  These semantic annotations can be
   supported by supervised and semi-supervised machine learning
   algorithms and enable data exchange among network operators, vendors
   and academia, making anomalies apprehensible for humans.  The
   proposed semantics uniforms the network anomaly data exchange between
   operators and vendors to improve their Service Disruption Detection
   Systems.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture] provides an overall
   introduction into how anomaly detection is applied to the IP network
   domain and which operational data are needed.  It approaches the
   problem space by automating what a network engineer would normally do
   when verifying a network connectivity service, monitoring the
   different network planes to understand wherever one network plane
   affects another negatively.

   As a Service Disruption Detection Systems may need to be fine tuned
   to effectively maintain good anomaly detection rates, the system need
   to generate analytical data that is reviewed by a network engineer.
   This process is defined in [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle],
   where the human engineer can be kept out of the monitoring process
   but needs to be involved in the alarm verification process.

   This document describes what information is needed to understand the
   analytical results produced by the Service Disruption Detection
   System.  The document proposes a set of semantically structured terms
   that can be used by a Service Disruption Detection System for
   comparing the results systematically, setting the baselines for
   supervised machine learning algorithms that require labeled
   operational data.

   This document proposes two YANG Service Models, a service topology
   model in Section 4.3 to describe the topology context and a YANG
   symptom model in Section 4.2 to describe the symptoms defined In
   Section 3.  Section 4.4 examples above Service Models in an Apache
   AVRO data model based on 'ietf-relevant-state.yang' data model
   defined in [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle].

3.  Observed Symptoms

   Observed network Symptoms are specified and categorized according to
   the following scheme:

   Action:  The action that a network node performed for a packet in the
      Forwarding Plane, a path or adjacency in the Control Plane, or the
      representation of resource state in the Management Plane or
      statistical changes recorded by the resources and reported in the
      Management Plane.  For Forwarding Plane we distinguish between
      *missing*, where the packet drop occurred outside the measured
      network node, *drop*, where the packet drop was performed by the
      measured network node, and *delay*, which defines the on-path
      delay measured on the network node.  For Control Plane we
      distinguish between *reachability*, which refers to a change in
      the routing or forwarding information base (RIB/FIB) and
      *adjacency* which refers to a change in a peering or link-layer
      resolution.  For Management Plane we refer to *state* or
      *statistical* change on the interface.

   Reason:  For each action, the reason describe why this action was
      performed.  For drops in Forwarding Plane we distinguish between
      *Unreachable*, because network layer reachability information was
      missing, *Administered*, because an administrator configured a

      rule preventing the forwarding of this packet, and *Corrupt*,
      where the network node was unable to determine the forwarding path
      due to a packet, software or hardware error.  For on-path delay we
      distinguish between *Minimum*, *Average* and *Maximum* delay for a
      given flow.  For Control Plane, we distinguish wherever a the
      reachability action was due to path *updates* or *withdraws* or
      the adjacency was *established* or *teared down*.  For Management
      Plane, we distinguish between interfaces states that are shown as
      *up* and *down*, and statistical counters that refer to *errors*,
      packet *discards* or *unknown protocol* counters.

   Trigger:  For each reason, the trigger describe why a network node
      has chosen that action.

   Table 1 consolidates the list of common symptoms related to the
   forwarding plane, defining the triplets action, reason and trigger.

4.  Semantic Metadata

   Operational Metadata adds additional context to collected metrics.
   For instance, in a network, the software version of the network node
   defines the version of the software release that generated Management
   Plane metrics [I-D.ietf-opsawg-collected-data-manifest].  Semantic
   Metadata, on the other hand, defines the meaning or ontology of the
   annotated data.  In this section a YANG model is defined in order to
   provide a structure for the metadata related to anomalies occurred in
   a network.  The module is intended to describe the metadata used for
   "annotating" the operational data collected from the network nodes,
   which include time series data, logs, as well as other forms of data
   that is "time-bounded".  The aspects discussed in this document are
   grouped under the concept of "anomaly" which represents a collection
   of symptoms.  The anomaly overall has a set of parameters that
   describe the overall behavior of the network in a given time-window
   including all the observed symptoms and outliers.

4.1.  Overview of the Models for the Symptom Semantic Metadata

   This section defines two YANG models, one defining a placeholder for
   the action reason trigger defined in this document, and one defining
   service topology information related to the anomaly.

4.2.1.  YANG Tree

   Figure 1 contains the YANG tree diagram [RFC8340] of the 'ietf-
   network-anomaly-symptom-cbl' module.  It augments the 'ietf-relevant-
   state' module defined in [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle].

   For each Symptom, the following parameters can be assigned: an
   Action, a Reason and a Trigger describing the Symptom; a Concern
   Score indicating how critical the Symptom is; and the associated
   network plane.

   Where the season enumeration declares wherever a workday or a holiday
   hase been taken into consideration for Contextual Outliers.  The
   template describes which approach and parameters have been used in

                                cbl' module.

   The module augments the anomaly of the 'relevant-state' container and
   the 'relevant-state-notification' of 'ietf-relevant-state' module
   defined in [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle].  The 'relevant-
   state' container is used for modifying the Symptom data in the
   Postmortem system, while the 'relevant-state-notification' is used
   for messaging from the Alarm Aggregation to the Postmortem and the
   Alarm and Problem Management system.

4.3.  YANG Module 'ietf-network-anomaly-service-topology'

4.3.1.  YANG Tree

   The YANG module has a service and a vpn-termination grouping defining
   a 'vpn-id', a 'vpn-name' 'site-ids' and a 'change-id' with 'start'
   and 'end time' for 'service' and 'hostname', 'VRF ID', 'VRF Name',
   'BGP route-distinguisher', 'BGP peer ip address', 'BGP path next-
   hop', 'node interface-id' and 'node interface-name' for 'node-
   termination' list and 'hostname', 'BGP route-distinguisher', 'BGP
   path next-hop' and 'BGP peer ip address' for 'network-termination'
   list.

   Within the NMOP working group we discuss with the SIMAP authors which
   existing YANG nodes instead could be used to facilitate a service and
   network topology context view.

4.3.2.  YANG Module

   The 'ietf-network-anomaly-service-topology' module defines reusable
   groupings for augmenting the 'relevant-state' model.  It defines
   placeholders for defining VPN information that is associated to the
   relevant state.

4.4.  Apache AVRO Schema

   Depending on implementation, a network operator might chose defined
   YANG models as data models or uses the YANG models as information
   data models and transform them to another schema format such as
   [Apache_AVRO] to use as data model for
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration] integration.

   Shows the entire notification schema of 'ietf-relevant-state.yang'
   from [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle], 'ietf-network-
   anomaly-service-topology.yang' from Section 4.3 and 'ietf-network-
   anomaly-symptom-cbl.yang' from Section 4.2 as an Apache AVRO schema.

   The Apache AVRO schema is decomposed based on YANG groupings as
   following:

   *  RelevantStateNotification.avsc is based on 'relevant-state-
      grouping' defined in 'ietf-relevant-state.yang' with
      'ietf.relevant.state.Publisher', 'ietf.relevant.state.Anomaly',
      'ietf.relevant.state.VpnNodeTermination' and
      'ietf.relevant.state.VpnService' AVRO schema imports.

   *  Publisher.avsc is based on 'publisher' container defined in 'ietf-
      relevant-state.yang'.

   *  Anomaly.avsc is based on 'anomaly-grouping' defined in 'ietf-
      relevant-state.yang' with 'ietf.relevant.state.Annotator' and
      'ietf.relevant.state.Symptom' AVRO schema imports.

   *  Annotator.avsc is based on 'anotator-grouping' defined in 'ietf-
      relevant-state.yang'.

   *  Symptom.avsc is based on 'cbl-symptom' defined in 'ietf-network-
      anomaly-symptom-cbl.yang'.

   *  L2VpnService.avsc, L2VpnServiceContainer.avsc, L3VpnService.avsc
      and L3VpnServiceContainer.avsc is based on 'vpn-service' defined
      in 'ietf-network-anomaly-service-topology.yang'.

   *  VpnTermination.avsc is based on 'vpn-termination' defined in
      'ietf-network-anomaly-service-topology.yang'.

   This document registers the following two YANG modules in the YANG
   Module Names registry [RFC3688]:

      Name: ietf-network-anomaly-symptom-cbl

      Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-network-anomaly-

      Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-network-anomaly-
      service-topology

      Prefix: smtopology

      Reference: RFC XXXX

6.  Security Considerations

   This section is modeled after the template described in Section 3.7
   of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

   The "ietf-network-anomaly-symptom-cbl" and "ietf-network-anomaly-
   service-topology" YANG modules defines two data models that are
   designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as
   NETCONF [RFC6141] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  These protocols have to
   use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH [RFC4252], TLS [RFC8446], and
   QUIC [RFC9000]) and have to use mutual authentication.

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true", which is the
   default).  All writable data nodes are likely to be reasonably
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write
   operations (e.g., edit-config) and delete operations to these data
   nodes without proper protection or authentication can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  The following subtrees and data nodes
   have particular sensitivities/vulnerabilities:

Internet-Draft          Network Anomaly Semantics          December 2025


   "There are no particularly sensitive writable data nodes."

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  Specifically, the following
   subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/
   vulnerabilities:

   "There are no particularly sensitive readable data nodes."

7.  Implementation status

   This section provides pointers to existing open source
   implementations of this draft.  Note to the RFC-editor: Please remove
   this before publishing.

7.1.  Antagonist

   A tool called Antagonist has been implemented and refined during the
   IETF 119 and 120 hackathons, in order to validate the application of
   the YANG models defined in this draft.  Antagonist provides visual
   support for two important use cases in the scope of this document:

   *  the generation of a ground truth in relation to Symptoms and
      Problems in timeseries data

   *  the visual validation of results produced by automated network
      anomaly detection tools.

   The open source code can be found here: [Antagonist]

7.2.  Cosmos Bright Lights

   A real-time streaming based Service Disruption Detection System has
   been deployed in Swisscom production as a proof of concept in June
   2024 monitoring approximate >13'000 L3 VPN's concurrently.  The
   Apache AVRO schema described in Section 4.4 is being implemented in
   April 2025 in the development enviroment and considered to be
   deployed in June 2025 in production.
