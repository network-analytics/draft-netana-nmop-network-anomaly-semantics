    <abstract>
      <t>This document explains why and how semantic metadata annotation helps
      to test, validate and compare outlier detection, supports supervised and
      semi-supervised machine learning development, enables data exchange
      among network operators, vendors and academia and make anomalies for
      humans apprehensible. The proposed semantics uniforms the network
      anomaly data exchange between and among operators and vendors to improve
      their network outlier detection systems.</t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="Ahf23">Network Anomaly Detection Architecture</xref>
      provides an overall introduction into how anomaly detection is being
      applied into the IP network domain and which operational data is needed.
      It approaches the problem space by automating what a Network Engineer
      would normally do when verifying a network connectivity service. Monitor
      from different network plane perspectives to understand wherever one
      network plane affects another negatively.</t>

      <t>In order to fine tune outlier detection, the results provided as
      analytical data need to be reviewed by a Network Engineer. Keeping the
      human out of the monitoring but still involving him in the alert
      verification loop.</t>

      <t>This document describes what information is needed to understand the
      output of the outlier detection for a Network Engineer, but also at the
      same time is semantically structured that it can be used for outlier
      detection testing by comparing the results systematically and set a
      baseline for supervised machine learning which requires labeled
      operational data.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Outlier_Detection" title="Outlier Detection">
      <t>Outlier Detection, also known as anomaly detection, describes a
      systematic approach to identify rare data points deviating significantly
      from the majority. Outliers can manifest as single data point or as a
      sequence of data points. There are multiple ways in general to classify
      anomalies, but for the context of this draft, the following three
      classes are taken into account:</t>

      <dl>
        <dt>Global outliers:</dt>

        <dd>An outlier is considered "global" if its behaviour is outside the
        entirety of the considered data set. For example, if the average
        dropped packet count is between 0 and 10 per minute and a small
        time-window gets the value 1000, this is considered a global
        anomaly.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl>
        <dt>Contextual outliers:</dt>

        <dd>An outlier is considered "contextual" if its behaviour is within a
        normal (expected) range, but it would not be expected based on some
        context. Context can be defined as a function of multiple parameters,
        such as time, location, etc. For example, the forwarded packet volume
        overnight reaches levels which might be totally normal for the
        daytime, but anomalous and unexpected for the nighttime.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl>
        <dt>Collective outliers:</dt>

        <dd>An outlier is considered "collective" if the behaviour of each
        single data point that are part of the anomaly are within expected
        ranges (so they are not anomalous it either a contextual or a global
        sense), but the group, taking all the data points together, is. Note
        that the group can be made within a single time series (a sequence of
        data points is anomalous) or across multiple metrics (e.g. if looking
        at two metrics together, the combined behavior turns out to be
        anomalous). In Network Telemetry time series, one way this can
        manifest is that the amount of network paths and interface state
        changes matches the time range when the forwarded packet volume
        decreases as a group.</dd>
      </dl>

      <t>For each outlier a score between 0 and 1 is being calculated. The
      higher the value, the higher the probability that the observed data
      point is an outlier. <xref target="VAP09">Anomaly detection: A
      survey</xref> gives additional details on anomaly detection and its
      types.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Data_Mesh" title="Data Mesh">
      <t>The <xref target="Deh22">Data Mesh</xref> Architecture distinguishes
      between operational and analytical data. Operational data refers to
      collected data from operational systems. While analytical data refers to
      insights gained from operational data.</t>

      <t>In terms of network observability, semantics of operational network
      metrics are defined by IETF and are categorized as described in the
      Network Telemetry Framework <xref target="RFC9232"/> in the following
      three different network planes:</t>

      <dl>
        <dt>Management Plane:</dt>

        <dd>Time series data describing the state changes and statistics of a
        network node and its components. For example, Interface state and
        statistics modelled in ietf-interfaces.yang <xref
        target="RFC8343"/></dd>
      </dl>

      <dl>
        <dt>Control Plane:</dt>

        <dd>Time series data describing the state and state changes of network
        reachability. For example, BGP VPNv6 unicast updates and withdrawals
        exported in BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) <xref target="RFC7854"/> and
        modeled in BGP <xref target="RFC4364"/></dd>
      </dl>

      <dl>
        <dt>Forwarding Plane:</dt>

        <dd>Time series data describing the forwarding behavior of packets and
        its data-plane context. For example, dropped packet count modelled in
        IPFIX entity forwardingStatus(IE89) <xref target="RFC7270"/> and
        packetDeltaCount(IE2) <xref target="RFC5102"/> and exportet with IPFIX
        <xref target="RFC7011"/>.</dd>
      </dl>

      <t>In terms of network observability, this applies to operational
      semantic metadata and service level indicators. The health status and
      symptoms described in the Service Assurance Intend Based Networking
      <xref target="RFC9418"/>, the precision availability metrics defined in
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-pam"/> or network anomalies and its symptoms
      as described in this document and applied in the network anomaly
      postmortem lifecycle described in <xref
      target="I-D.netana-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle"/> where the applied
      semantic metadata of this document is refined for each detected
      anomaly.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Observed_Symptoms" title="Observed Symptoms">
      <t>In this section observed network symptoms are specified and
      categorized according to the following scheme:</t>

      <dl>
        <dt>Action:</dt>

        <dd>
          <t>Which action the network node performed for a packet in the
          Forwarding Plane, a path or adjacency in the Control Plane or state
          or statistical changes in the Management Plane. For Forwarding Plane
          we distinguish between missing, where the drop occured outside the
          measured network node, drop and on-path delay, which was measured on
          the network node. For Control Plane we distinguish between
          reachability, which refers to a change in the routing or forwarding
          information base (RIB/FIB) and adjcacency which refers to a change
          in peering or link-layer resolution. For Management Plane we refer
          to state or statistical changes on interfaces.</t>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <dl>
        <dt>Reason:</dt>

        <dd>
          <t>For each action, one or more reasons describe why this action was
          used. For Drops in Forwarding Plane we distinguish between
          Unreachable because network layer reachability information was
          missing, Administered because an administrator configured a rule
          preventing the forwarding for this packet and Corrupt where the
          network node was unable to determine where to forward to due to
          packet, software or hardware error. For on-path delay we distinguish
          between Minimum, Average and Maximum Delay for a given flow. For
          Control Plane wherever a the reachability was updated or withdrawn
          or the adjcacency was established or teared down. For Management
          Plane we distinguish between interfaces states up and down, and
          statistical erros, discards or unknown protocol counters.</t>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <dl>
        <dt>Cause:</dt>

        <dd>
          <t>For each reason one or more cause describe the cause why the
          network node has chosen that action.</t>

      <t>Metadata adds additional context to data. For instance, in networks
      the software version of a network node where Management Plane metrics
      are obtained from as described in<xref
      target="I-D.claise-opsawg-collected-data-manifest"/>. Where in Semantic
      Metadata the meaning or ontology of the annotated data is being
      described. In this section a YANG model is defined in order to provide a
      structure for the metadata related to anomalies happening in the
      network. The module is intended to describe the metadata used to
      "annotate" the operational data collected from the network nodes, which
      can include time series data and logs, as well as other forms of data
      that is "time-bounded". The aspects discussed so far in this document
      are grouped under the concept of "anomaly" which represents a collection
      of symptoms. The anomaly overall has a set of parameters that describe
      the overall behavior of the network in a given time-window including all
      the spotted symptoms (network anomalies).</t>

        atart and end time to specify the time-window, a confident score
        indicating how accurate the symptom was detected, a concern score
        indicating how critical the symptom is, the annotator indicating if it
        has been identified by a network expert or an algorithm, the tags with
