       Semantic Metadata Annotation for Network Anomaly Detection
             draft-netana-nmop-network-anomaly-semantics-03

Abstract

   This document explains why and how semantic metadata annotation helps
   to test, validate and compare outlier detection, supports supervised
   and semi-supervised machine learning development, enables data
   exchange among network operators, vendors and academia and make
   anomalies for humans apprehensible.  The proposed semantics uniforms
   the network anomaly data exchange between and among operators and
   vendors to improve their network outlier detection systems.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.netana-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture] provides an overall
   introduction into how anomaly detection is being applied into the IP
   network domain and which operational data is needed.  It approaches
   the problem space by automating what a Network Engineer would
   normally do when verifying a network connectivity service.  Monitor
   from different network plane perspectives to understand wherever one

   network plane affects another negatively.

   In order to fine tune outlier detection as described in
   [I-D.netana-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle], the results provided as
   analytical data need to be reviewed by a Network Engineer.  Keeping
   the human out of the monitoring but still involving him in the alert
   verification loop.

   This document describes what information is needed to understand the
   output of the outlier detection for a Network Engineer, but also at
   the same time is semantically structured that it can be used for
   outlier detection testing by comparing the results systematically and
   set a baseline for supervised machine learning which requires labeled
   operational data.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Terminology

   This document defines the following terms:

   Message Broker: is an intermediary software component that translates
   messages from the formal messaging protocol of the sender to the
   formal messaging protocol of the receiver routed in topics.  Message
   brokers are elements in Data Mesh where software applications
   communicate by exchanging formally-defined messages.

   Stream Catalog: provides a single point of access that allows users
   to centrally search semantics for information across a Message
   Broker.

   Additionally it makes use of the terms defined in
   [I-D.netana-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture] and
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology].

   The following terms are used as defined in
   [I-D.netana-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture]:

   *  Outlier

   [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology]:

3.  Observed Symptoms

   In this section observed network symptoms are specified and
   categorized according to the following scheme:

   Action:  Which action the network node performed for a packet in the
      Forwarding Plane, a path or adjacency in the Control Plane or
      state or statistical changes in the Management Plane.  For
      Forwarding Plane we distinguish between missing, where the drop
      occurred outside the measured network node, drop and on-path
      delay, which was measured on the network node.  For Control Plane
      we distinguish between reachability, which refers to a change in
      the routing or forwarding information base (RIB/FIB) and adjacency
      which refers to a change in peering or link-layer resolution.  For
      Management Plane we refer to state or statistical changes on
      interfaces.

   Reason:  For each action, one or more reasons describe why this

      action was used.  For Drops in Forwarding Plane we distinguish
      between Unreachable because network layer reachability information
      was missing, Administered because an administrator configured a
      rule preventing the forwarding for this packet and Corrupt where
      the network node was unable to determine where to forward to due
      to packet, software or hardware error.  For on-path delay we
      distinguish between Minimum, Average and Maximum Delay for a given
      flow.  For Control Plane wherever a the reachability was updated
      or withdrawn or the adjacency was established or teared down.  For
      Management Plane we distinguish between interfaces states up and
      down, and statistical errors, discards or unknown protocol
      counters.

   Cause:  For each reason one or more cause describe the cause why the
      network node has chosen that action.

   Table 1 consolidates for the forwarding plane a list of common
   symptoms with their Actions, Reasons and Causes.

4.  Semantic Metadata

   Metadata adds additional context to data.  For instance, in networks
   the software version of a network node where Management Plane metrics
   are obtained from as described
   in[I-D.claise-opsawg-collected-data-manifest].  Where in Semantic
   Metadata the meaning or ontology of the annotated data is being
   described.  In this section a YANG model is defined in order to
   provide a structure for the metadata related to anomalies happening
   in the network.  The module is intended to describe the metadata used
   to "annotate" the operational data collected from the network nodes,
   which can include time series data and logs, as well as other forms
   of data that is "time-bounded".  The aspects discussed so far in this
   document are grouped under the concept of "anomaly" which represents
   a collection of symptoms.  The anomaly overall has a set of
   parameters that describe the overall behavior of the network in a
   given time-window including all the spotted symptoms (network
   anomalies).

4.1.  Overview of the Model for the Symptom Semantic Metadata

   Figure 2 contains the YANG tree diagram [RFC8340] of the Figure 1
   which augments the [RFC8343] defined ietf-interfaces and the

   For each symptom, the following parameters have been assigned: A
   unique ID for identification, a description of the symptom, a list of
   affected metrics or counters, start and end time to specify the time-
   window, a confident score indicating how accurate the symptom was
   detected, a concern score indicating how critical the symptom is, the
   annotator indicating if it has been identified by a network expert or
   an algorithm, the tags with key value where Action, Reason and Cause
   can be annotated as described in previous section.

   The security considerations.

6.  Implementation status

   This section provides pointers to existing open source
   implementations of this draft.  Note to the RFC-editor: Please remove
   this before publishing.

6.1.  Antagonist

   A tool called Antagonist has been implemented during the IETF 119
   Hackathon, in order to validate the application of the YANG models
   defined in this draft.  Antagonist provides visual support for two
   important use cases in the scope of this document:

   *  the generation of a ground truth in relation to symptoms and
      problems in timeseries data

   *  the visual validation of results produced by automated network
      anomaly detection tools.

   The open source code can be found here: [Antagonist]

   valuable comment.
