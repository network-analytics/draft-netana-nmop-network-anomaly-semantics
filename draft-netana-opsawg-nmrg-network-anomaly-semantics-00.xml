    <abstract>
      <t>This document explains why and how semantic metadata annotation helps
      to test and validate outlier detection, supports supervised and
      semi-supervised machine learning development and make anomalies for
      humans apprehensible. The proposed semantics uniforms the network
      anomaly data exchange between and among operators and vendors to improve
      their network outlier detection systems.</t>

      <section anchor="Outlier_Detection_Intro" title="Outlier Detection">
        <t>Outlier Detection, also known as anomaly detection, describes a
        systematic approach to identify rare data points deviating
        significantly from the majority. Outliers are classified in three
        categories:</t>

        <dl>
          <dt>Global outliers:</dt>

          <dd>A data point is considered a global outlier if its value is far
          outside the entirety of a data set. For example, an average dropped
          packet count is between 0 and 10 per minute during a one week
          observation and the observed global outlier was 100000 packets.</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt>Contextual outliers:</dt>

          <dd>A data point is considered a contextual outlier if its value
          significantly deviates from the rest of the data points in the same
          time series context. For example, the forwarded packet volume in a
          timeseries are changing during the time of the day like an
          oscillation curve, where the observed contextual packet volume
          outlier is outside the oscillation curve at that moment in time. At
          another time the same value could be considered normal.</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt>Collective outliers:</dt>

          <dd>A subset of data points within a data set is considered
          anomalous if those values as a collection deviate significantly from
          the entire data set, but the values of the individual data points
          are not themselves anomalous in either a contextual or global sense.
          In Network Telemetry time series, one way this can manifest is that
          the amount of network path and interface state changes matches the
          time range when the forwarded packet volume decreases as a
          group.</dd>
        </dl>
      </section>

      <section anchor="Data_Mesh_Intro" title="Data Mesh">
        <t>The <xref target="Deh22">Data Mesh</xref> Architecture
        distinguishes between operational and analytical data. Operational
        data refers to collected data from operational systems. While
        analytical data refers to insights gained from operational data.</t>

        <t>In terms of network observability, semantics of operational network
        metrics are defined by IETF and are categorized as described in the
        Network Telemetry Framework <xref target="RFC9232"/> in the following
        three different network planes:</t>

        <dl>
          <dt>Management Plane:</dt>

          <dd>Time series data describing the state changes and statistics of
          a network node and its components. For example, Interface state and
          statistics modelled in ietf-interfaces.yang <xref
          target="RFC8343"/></dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt>Control Plane:</dt>

          <dd>Time series data describing the state and state changes of
          network reachability. For example, BGP VPNv6 unicast updates and
          withdrawals exported in BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) <xref
          target="RFC7854"/> and modeled in BGP <xref target="RFC4364"/></dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt>Forwarding Plane:</dt>

          <dd>Time series data describing the forwarding behavior of packets
          and its data-plane context. For example, dropped packet count
          modelled in IPFIX entity forwardingStatus(IE89) <xref
          target="RFC7270"/> and packetDeltaCount(IE2) <xref
          target="RFC5102"/> and exportet with IPFIX <xref
          target="RFC7011"/>.</dd>
        </dl>

        <t>In terms of network observability, semantics of analytical data
        refers to incident notifications or service level indicators. For
        example the incident notification described in Section 7.2 of <xref
        target="I-D.feng-opsawg-incident-management"/>, the health status and
        symptoms described in the Service Assurance Intend Based Networking
        <xref target="RFC9418"/> or the precision availability metrics defined
        in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-pam"/> or network anomalies and its
        symptoms as described in this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="Semantic_Metadata_Intro" title="Semantic Metadata">
        <t>Metadata adds additional context to data. For instance, in networks
        the software version of a network node where management plane metrics
        are obtained from as described in <xref
        target="I-D.claise-opsawg-collected-data-manifest"/>. Where in
        Semantic Metadata the meaning or ontology of the annotated data is
        being described.</t>

        <t>For example a global network outlier describes a data point of a
        high packet count with packetDeltaCount(IE2) of dropped traffic with
        reason code dropped and status code unrouteable in
        forwardingStatus(IE89). The annotation would be that it is classified
        as global network outlier in the forwarding plane of a network.</t>

        <t>It could also have been observed alongside a control plane time
        series for the same network service where network reachability has
        been withdrawed with BGP. In case of collective network outlier, the
        same data points would now being described as collective network
        outlier in the forwarding plane with a control plane network
        reachability withdrawal and customer impacting context.</t>
