    description
        "This module defines objects for the description of network incidents.
         Incidents are a collection of observability data produced by devices,
         such as network nodes, that represent the behaviour of the system over
         time.

         This can be intended to be measured by mean of counters and gauges
         collected from the network nodes, as well as logs, and other forms of
         real time data that is collected and exported, with the scope to be
         further analysed.

         The module proposed in this document aims at adding meaningful metadata
          to the incident data itself.
