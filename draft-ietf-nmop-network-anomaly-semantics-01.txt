       Semantic Metadata Annotation for Network Anomaly Detection
              draft-ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-semantics-01

Abstract

   This document explains why and how semantic metadata annotation helps
   to test, validate and compare Outlier and Symptom detection, supports
   supervised and semi-supervised machine learning development, enables
   data exchange among network operators, vendors and academia and make
   anomalies for humans apprehensible.  The proposed semantics uniforms
   the network anomaly data exchange between and among operators and
   vendors to improve their Service Disruption Detection Systems.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture] provides an overall
   introduction into how anomaly detection is being applied into the IP
   network domain and which operational data is needed.  It approaches
   the problem space by automating what a network engineer would
   normally do when verifying a network connectivity service.  Monitor
   from different network plane perspectives to understand wherever one
   network plane affects another negatively.

   In order to fine tune Service Disruption Detection as described in
   [I-D.netana-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle], the results provided as
   analytical data need to be reviewed by a Network Engineer.  Keeping
   the human out of the monitoring but still involving him in the alarm
   verification loop.

   This document describes what information is needed to understand the
   output of the Service Disruption Detection for a Network Engineer,
   but also at the same time is semantically structured that it can be
   used for Service Disruption Detection System testing by comparing the
   results systematically and set a baseline for supervised machine
   learning which requires labeled operational data.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Observed Symptoms

   Observed network Symptoms are specified and categorized according to
   the following scheme:

   Action:  Which action a network node performed for a packet in the
      Forwarding Plane, a path or adjacency in the Control Plane or
      state or statistical changes in the Management Plane.  For
      Forwarding Plane we distinguish between missing, where the drop
      occurred outside the measured network node, drop and on-path
      delay, which was measured on the network node.  For Control Plane
      we distinguish between reachability, which refers to a change in
      the routing or forwarding information base (RIB/FIB) and adjacency
      which refers to a change in peering or link-layer resolution.  For
      Management Plane we refer to state or statistical changes on
      interfaces.

   Reason:  For each action, one or more reasons describe why this
      action was used.  For Drops in Forwarding Plane we distinguish
      between Unreachable because network layer reachability information
      was missing, Administered because an administrator configured a
      rule preventing the forwarding for this packet and Corrupt where
      the network node was unable to determine where to forward to due
      to packet, software or hardware error.  For on-path delay we
      distinguish between Minimum, Average and Maximum Delay for a given
      flow.  For Control Plane wherever a the reachability was updated
      or withdrawn or the adjacency was established or teared down.  For
      Management Plane we distinguish between interfaces states up and
      down, and statistical errors, discards or unknown protocol
      counters.

   Cause:  For each reason one or more causes describe why a network
      node has chosen that action.

   Symptoms with their Actions, Reasons and Causes.

4.  Semantic Metadata

   Metadata adds additional context to data.  For instance, in networks
   the software version of a network node where Management Plane metrics
   are obtained from as described
   in[I-D.claise-opsawg-collected-data-manifest].  Where in Semantic
   Metadata the meaning or ontology of the annotated data is being
   described.  In this section a YANG model is defined in order to
   provide a structure for the metadata related to anomalies happening
   in the network.  The module is intended to describe the metadata used
   to "annotate" the operational data collected from the network nodes,
   which can include time series data and logs, as well as other forms
   of data that is "time-bounded".  The aspects discussed so far in this
   document are grouped under the concept of "anomaly" which represents
   a collection of Symptoms.  The anomaly overall has a set of
   parameters that describe the overall behavior of the network in a
   given time-window including all the observed Symptoms and Outliers.

4.1.  Overview of the Model for the Symptom Semantic Metadata

   Figure 1 contains the YANG tree diagram [RFC8340] of the Figure 2
   which augments the [I-D.netana-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle]
   defined ietf-relevant-state.

   For each Symptom, the following parameters have been assigned:
   Action, Reason and Cause to describe the Symptom, a concern score
   indicating how critical the Symptom is and with Forwarding, Control
   and Management to which network plane the Symptom can be attributed
   to.

          +--:(management)
             +-- management?   empty

   The module augments the anomaly of the relevant-state container and
   the relevant-state-notification of ietf-relevant-state defined in
   [I-D.netana-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle].  The relevant-state
   container is used for modifying the Symptom data in the Postmortem
   system.  Where the relevant-state-notification is used for messaging
   from the Alarm Aggregation to the Postmortem and the Alarm and
   Problem Management system.

4.3.  YANG Service Topology Module

   The YANG module has a service and a node-termination grouping
   defining vpn-id, vpn-name and site-ids for service and hostname, BGP
   route-distinguisher, BGP peer ip address, BGP path next-hop and node
   interface-id.

   Within the NMOP working group we discuss with the Digital Map authors
   which existing YANG nodes instead could be used to facilitate a
   service and network topology context view.

6.  Implementation status

   This section provides pointers to existing open source
   implementations of this draft.  Note to the RFC-editor: Please remove
   this before publishing.

6.1.  Antagonist

   A tool called Antagonist has been implemented and refined during the
   IETF 119 and 120 hackathons, in order to validate the application of
   the YANG models defined in this draft.  Antagonist provides visual
   support for two important use cases in the scope of this document:

   *  the generation of a ground truth in relation to Symptoms and
      Problems in timeseries data

   *  the visual validation of results produced by automated network
      anomaly detection tools.
