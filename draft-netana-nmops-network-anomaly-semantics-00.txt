       Semantic Metadata Annotation for Network Anomaly Detection
            draft-netana-nmops-network-anomaly-semantics-00

Abstract

   This document explains why and how semantic metadata annotation helps
   to test and validate anomaly detection, supports supervised and semi-
   supervised machine learning development and make anomalies for humans
   apprehensible.  The proposed semantics uniforms the network anomaly
   data exchange between and among operators and vendors to improve
   their network anomaly detection systems.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Anomaly Detection

   Anomaly Detection describes a systematic approach to identify.
   outliers, which are rare data points deviating significantly from the
   majority.  Outliers are classified in three categories:

   Global outliers:
      A data point is considered a global outlier if its value is far
      outside the entirety of a data set.  For example, an average
      dropped packet count is between 0 and 10 per minute during a one
      week observation and the observed global outlier was 100000
      packets.

   Contextual outliers:
      A data point is considered a contextual outlier if its value
      significantly deviates from the rest of the data points in the
      same time series context.  For example, the forwarded packet
      volume in a timeseries are changing during the time of the day
      like an oscillation curve, where the observed contextual packet
      volume outlier is outside the oscillation curve at that moment in
      time.  At another time the same value could be considered normal.

   Collective outliers:
      A subset of data points within a data set is considered anomalous
      if those values as a collection deviate significantly from the
      entire data set, but the values of the individual data points are
      not themselves anomalous in either a contextual or global sense.
      In network telemetry time series, one way this can manifest is
      that the amount of network path and interface state changes
      matches the time range when the forwarded packet volume decreases
      as a group.

1.2.  Data Mesh

   The Data Mesh [Deh22] Architecture distinguishes between operational
   and analytical data.  Operational data refers to collected data from
   operational systems.  While analytical data refers to insights gained
   from operational data.

   In terms of network observability, semantics of operational network
   metrics are defined by IETF and are categorized as described in the
   Network Telemetry Frameork [RFC9232] in the following three different
   network planes:

   Management Plane:
      Time series data describing the state changes and statistics of a
      network node and its components.  For example, Interface state and
      statistics modelled in ietf-interfaces.yang [RFC8343]

   Control Plane:
      Time series data describing the state and state changes of network
      reachability.  For example, BGP VPNv6 unicast updates and
      withdrawals exported in BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) [RFC7854]
      and modeled in BGP [RFC4364]

   Forwarding Plane:
      Time series data describing the forwarding behavior of packets and
      its data-plane context.  For example, dropped packet count
      modelled in IPFIX entity forwardingStatus(IE89) [RFC7270] and
      packetDeltaCount(IE2) [RFC5102] and exportet with IPFIX [RFC7011].

   In terms of network observability, semantics of analytical data
   refers to incident notifications or service level indicators.  For
   example the incident notification described in Section 7.2 of
   [I-D.feng-opsawg-incident-management], the health status and symptoms
   described in the Service Assurance Intend Based Networking [RFC9418]
   or the precision availability metrics defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-pam]
   or Network Anomalies and its Symptoms as described in this document.

1.3.  Semantic Metadata

   Metadata adds additional context to data.  For instance, in networks
   the software version of a network node where management plane metrics
   are obtained from as described in
   [I-D.claise-opsawg-collected-data-manifest].  Where in Semantic
   Metadata the meaning or ontology of the annotated data is being
   described.

   For example a global outlier in Network Anomaly detection describing
   a data point of a high packet count with packetDeltaCount(IE2) of
   dropped traffic with reason code dropped and status code unrouteable
   in forwardingStatus(IE89).  The annotation would be that it is
   classified as global outlier network anomaly in the forwarding plane
   of a network.  It could also have been observed alongside a control
   plane time series for the same network service where network
   reachability has been withdrawed with BGP.

   In case of collective outlier in network anomaly detection, the same
   data points would now being described as collective outlier network
   anomaly in the forwarding plane with a control plane network
   reachability withdrawal and customer impacting context.
