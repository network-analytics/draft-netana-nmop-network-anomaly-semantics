       Semantic Metadata Annotation for Network Anomaly Detection
              draft-ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-semantics-03

Abstract

   This document explains the motivation for defining semantic metadata
   annotations to help testing, validating and comparing Outlier and
   Symptom detection systems.  These semantic annotations can be
   supported by supervised and semi-supervised machine learning
   algorithms and enable data exchange among network operators, vendors
   and academia, making anomalies apprehensible for humans.  The
   proposed semantics uniforms the network anomaly data exchange between
   operators and vendors to improve their Service Disruption Detection
   Systems.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture] provides an overall
   introduction into how anomaly detection is applied to the IP network
   domain and which operational data are needed.  It approaches the
   problem space by automating what a network engineer would normally do
   when verifying a network connectivity service, monitoring the
   different network planes to understand wherever one network plane
   affects another negatively.

   As a Service Disruption Detection Systems may need to be fine tuned
   to effectively maintain good anomaly detection rates, the system need
   to generate analytical data that is reviewed by a network engineer.
   This process is defined in
   [I-D.netana-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle], where the human engineer
   can be kept out of the monitoring process but needs to be involved in
   the alarm verification process.

   This document describes what information is needed to understand the
   analytical results produced by the Service Disruption Detection
   System.  The document proposes a set of semantically structured terms
   that can be used by a Service Disription Detection System for
   comparing the results systematically, setting the baselines for
   supervised machine learning algorithms that require labeled
   operational data.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture] and
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology].

   The following terms are used as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture]:

   *  Outlier Detection

   *  Service Disruption Detection

   *  Service Disruption Detection System

   The following terms are used as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology]:

   *  System

   *  State

   *  Problem

   *  Symptom

   *  Cause

   *  Alarm

3.  Observed Symptoms

   Observed network Symptoms are specified and categorized according to
   the following scheme:

   Action:  Defines the operation that a network node performes when
      forwarding a packet in the Forwarding Plane, a path or adjacency
      event in the Control Plane or a state or statistical change in the
      Management Plane.  For Forwarding Plane we distinguish between
      *missing*, where the packet drop occurred outside the measured
      network node, *drop*, where the packet drop was performed by the
      measured network node, and *delay*, which defines the on-path
      delay measured on the network node.  For Control Plane we
      distinguish between *reachability*, which refers to a change in
      the routing or forwarding information base (RIB/FIB) and
      *adjacency* which refers to a change in a peering or link-layer
      resolution.  For Management Plane we refer to *state* or
      *statistical* changes on interfaces.

   Reason:  For each action, the reason describe why this action was
      performed.  For drops in Forwarding Plane we distinguish between
      *Unreachable*, because network layer reachability information was
      missing, *Administered*, because an administrator configured a
      rule preventing the forwarding of this packet, and *Corrupt*,
      where the network node was unable to determine the forwarding path
      due to a packet, software or hardware error.  For on-path delay we
      distinguish between *Minimum*, *Average* and *Maximum* delay for a
      given flow.  For Control Plane, we distinguish wherever a the
      reachability action was due to path *updates* or *withdraws* or
      the adjacency was *established* or *teared down*. For Management
      Plane, we distinguish between interfaces states that are shown as
      *up* and *down*, and statistical counters that refer to *errors*,
      packet *discards* or *unknown protocol* counters.

   Cause:  For each reason, the cause describe why a network node has
      chosen that action.

   forwarding plane, defining the triplets action, reason and cause.

4.  Semantic Metadata

   Operational Metadata adds additional context to collected metrics.
   For instance, in a network, the software version of the network node
   defines the version of the software release that generated Management
   Plane metrics [I-D.claise-opsawg-collected-data-manifest].  Semantic
   Metadata, on the other hand, defines the meaning or ontology of the
   annotated data.  In this section a YANG model is defined in order to
   provide a structure for the metadata related to anomalies occurred in
   a network.  The module is intended to describe the metadata used for
   "annotating" the operational data collected from the network nodes,
   which include time series data, logs, as well as other forms of data
   that is "time-bounded".  The aspects discussed in this document are
   grouped under the concept of "anomaly" which represents a collection
   of symptoms.  The anomaly overall has a set of parameters that
   describe the overall behavior of the network in a given time-window
   including all the observed symptoms and outliers.

4.1.  Overview of the Model for the Symptom Semantic Metadata

   Figure 1 contains the YANG tree diagram [RFC8340] of the 'ietf-
   network-anomaly-symptom-cbl' module.  It augments the 'ietf-relevant-
   state' module defined in [I-D.netana-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle].

   For each Symptom, the following parameters can be assigned: an
   Action, a Reason and a Cause describing the Symptom; a concern score
   indicating how critical the Symptom is; and the associated network
   plane.

   module: ietf-network-anomaly-symptom-cbl

     augment /rsn:relevant-state/rsn:anomalies/rsn:anomaly/rsn:symptom:
       +--rw action?          string
       +--rw reason?          string
       +--rw cause?           string
       +--rw network-plane?   enumeration
     augment /rsn:relevant-state-notification/rsn:anomalies/rsn:anomaly
               /rsn:symptom:
       +-- action?          string
       +-- reason?          string
       +-- cause?           string
       +-- network-plane?   enumeration

       Figure 1: YANG tree diagram for 'ietf-network-anomaly-symptom-
                                cbl' module.

   The module augments the anomaly of the 'relevant-state' container and
   the 'relevant-state-notification' of 'ietf-relevant-state' module
   defined in [I-D.netana-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle].  The
   'relevant-state' container is used for modifying the Symptom data in
   the Postmortem system, while the 'relevant-state-notification' is
   used for messaging from the Alarm Aggregation to the Postmortem and
   the Alarm and Problem Management system.

   TBD Alex: shall we remove this yang tree?  It is not defined here.

4.3.  YANG Module 'ietf-network-anomaly-service-topology'

   The YANG module has a service and a node-termination grouping
   defining a 'vpn-id', a 'vpn-name' and 'site-ids' for service and
   hostname, BGP route-distinguisher, BGP peer ip address, BGP path
   next-hop and node interface-id.

   Within the NMOP working group we discuss with the Digital Map authors
   which existing YANG nodes instead could be used to facilitate a
   service and network topology context view.

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-netmod-
   rfc8407bis-22#name-security-considerations-sect.

6.  Implementation status

   This section provides pointers to existing open source
   implementations of this draft.  Note to the RFC-editor: Please remove
   this before publishing.

6.1.  Antagonist

   A tool called Antagonist has been implemented and refined during the
   IETF 119 and 120 hackathons, in order to validate the application of
   the YANG models defined in this draft.  Antagonist provides visual
   support for two important use cases in the scope of this document:

   *  the generation of a ground truth in relation to Symptoms and
      Problems in timeseries data

   *  the visual validation of results produced by automated network
      anomaly detection tools.

   The open source code can be found here: [Antagonist]

7.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank , for his review and valuable
   comment.

   The authors would like to thank Antonio Roberto for his contribution
   to the ideas in this draft and Reshad Rahman and Mohamed Boucadair
   for his review and valuable comments.
